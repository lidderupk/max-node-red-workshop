## Workshop
Follow the steps in wiki.

## Event Description
Have you ever wanted to classify images, recognize faces or places in images, process natural language or text, or create recommendations based on time-series data in one of your applications?

Join IBM Developer's meetup and learn how!

With deep-learning (machine learning using deep neural networks) you can do this, and much more. The Model Asset eXchange (MAX) on IBM Developer is a place where you can find and use free open source deep learning models for text, image, audio, and video processing.

The exchange makes ready-to-use deep learning models available that have been well tested, are free to use and include provenance. The curated list includes deployable models that you can run as a microservice locally or in the cloud on Docker or Kubernetes, and trainable models where you can use your own data to train the models. We will give an overview of MAX, look at the different models available, and finally download a deploy a ML model locally and on IBM Cloud in containers using Docker and Kubernetes.
